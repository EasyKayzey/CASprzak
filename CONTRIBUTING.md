# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Z_CASprzak. Following these guidelines will resolve many problems before they even happen. 

The config of the project (the `functions` package) is relatively set-in-stone, though we always welcome ideas. This isn't to say you cannot contribute to it; it will just be harder to accept changes to existing files.

The main help we need in Z_CASprzak is in the front-end and environment - especially front-end. We are a team of two back-end developers, and anybody who wants to develop better UI will be greatly appreciated.

Contact us with any other ideas you have: things like improving documentation, writing a wiki, or bug triage would also be greatly appreciated.

# Ground Rules
Responsibilities:
- Be respectful!
- Do not break existing features.
- Treat all `Function`s  as `final`, and NEVER modify their fields in runtime!
- Discuss early, discuss often. If you want to sum a major feature, don't waste your time without verifying we agree it has merit.
- Commit early, commit often. 
- Write extensive JUnit tests for any features you implement.
- Create issues for features you want to sum, especially for bugs you find.
- You can always contact us at `easykaysey@googlegroups.com` if you have any questions.

# Getting started
### For significant contributions:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Write the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, make a pull request to merge TO A NEW BRANCH

Make sure to follow the example of existing code for code style.

### For small fixes:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Write the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, make a pull request to merge to master (or the branch with the issue)

A small change is something that does not introduce new functionality. Some examples:
- Spelling or grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean-up
- Adding logging messages or debugging output
- Changes to ‘metadata’ files
- Moving source files from one directory or package to another

Make sure to follow the example of existing code for whitespace style.

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email easykayzey@googlegroups.com instead.

Otherwise, file bug reports using the bug report issue template.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you want to suggest a feature, file an issue using the feature suggestion issue template. Explain the use-case for the feature, and why it should be included in Z_CASprzak.

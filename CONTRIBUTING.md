# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Z_CASprzak. Following these guidelines will resolve many problems before they even happen. 

The core of the project (the `functions` package) is relatively set-in-stone, though we always welcome ideas. This isn't to say you cannot contribute to it; it will just be harder to accept changes to existing files.

The main help we need in Z_CASprzak is in the front-end and environment - especially front-end. We are a team of two back-end developers, and anybody who wants to develop better UI will be greatly appreciated.

Contact us with any other ideas you have: things like improving documentation, writing a wiki, or bug triaging would also be greatly appreciated.

# Ground Rules
Responsibilities:
- Be respectful!
- Do not break existing features.
- Treat all `Function`s  as `final`, and NEVER modify their fields in runtime!
- Discuss early, discuss often. If you want to add a major feature, don't waste your time without verifying we agree it has merit.
- Commit early, commit often. 
- Write extensive JUnit tests for any features you implement.
- Create issues for features you want to add, especially for bugs you find.
- You can always contact us at `easykaysey@googlegroups.com` if you have any questions.

# Getting started
### For significant contributions:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Write the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, make a pull request to merge TO A NEW BRANCH

### For small fixes:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Write the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, make a pull request to merge to master (or the branch with the issue)

A small change is something that does not introduce new functionality. Some examples:
- Spelling or grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean-up
- Adding logging messages or debugging output
- Changes to ‘metadata’ files
- Moving source files from one directory or package to another


# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

If you don’t want to use your personal contact information, set up a “security@” email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.)

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
>
> Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

# BONUS: Code, commit message and labeling conventions
These sections are not necessary, but can help streamline the contributions you receive.

### Explain your preferred style for code, if you have any.

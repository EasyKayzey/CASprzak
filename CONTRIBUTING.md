# CASprzak Code of Conduct

## Our Vision
Z_CASprzak is a computer-algebra framework mainly for storing, modifying, and applying mathematical functions and functionals. To fully realize this vision, an interface has to be created:
 - Core functionality
   - Function storage
   - Function evaluation
   - Function differentiation and integration
 - Function parsing
 - GUI
 - Command-line interface 
 - Official packaging
Some of this is done already, and some is not. If you would like to modify the core functionality, we strongly recommend contacting us at easykayzey@googlegroups.com to discuss. Help in the other realms is most needed; we are mainly back-end developers, but always willing to learn. 

## Documentation
At the time of writing, the CAS is mostly documented in javadocs but not hosted anywhere yet. If you are reading this in the future, and it is not completed and hosted yet, feel free to remind us. In the present, if you wish to see the documentation, please generate it from a clone.

# Z_CASprzak
Z_CASprzak is a Computer Algebra System (CAS) written by The EasyKayzey Show (Erez Israeli Miller and Michael Kasprzak)

Hello, and welcome to our CAS. This is a joint project by The EasyKayzey Show started at HackBCA V, 2020. Z_CASprzak is a computer-algebra framework mainly for storing, modifying, and applying mathematical functions and functionals, and it currently has a small command-line demo.

## Functionality
### Core
- Storage of functions in an artifical data type
- Expression simplification
- Differentiation of functions 
  - Storing derivatives as new functions
- Evaluation of functions
- Various solver tools
  - Finding zeroes of functions using Newton's or Halley's Method
  - Finding the local maxima or minima of functions on a range
- Generating Taylor Series from functions
- Numerical integration via Simpson's rule
### Other
- Parsing and storing infix expressions like `x^2-3y+sin(1/z)`
- Command-line interface
  - Definition and storage of functions
  - Evaluating, differentiating, and numerically integrating functions
  - Solving for zeroes and extrema of functions
  - Substituting stored functions into variables
  - Generating taylor series of functions from a point
  - Defining special constants
  - Defining and removing variables

## Notes
- If you find a problem with the CAS, please report the bug in `Issues` so we can fix it
- If you have any feature suggestions not present in `Projects`, make a feature request in `Issues`
- If you would like to design a better interface than the placeholder that we have now, please contact us by email

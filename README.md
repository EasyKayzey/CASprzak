# Z_CASprzak
Z_CASprzak is a CAS by The EasyKayzey Show (Erez Israeli Miller and Michael Kasprzak)

Hello, and welcome to our Computer Algebra System. This is a joint project by The EasyKayzey Show started at HackBCA V, 2020. Z_CASprzak is a computer-algebra framework mainly for storing, modifying, and applying mathematical functions and functionals, and it currently has a small command-line demo.

## Functionality
### Core
- Expression simplification
- Differentiation of functions, storing derivatives as new functions
- Evaluation of functions
- Finding zeroes of expressions using Newton's Method
- Finding the local maxima or minima of any function on a range
- Creating Taylor Series from any function
- Numerical integration via Simpson's rule
### Other
- Parsing and storing expressions like `x^2-3y+sin(1/z)`
- Command-line interface

## Notes
- If you find a problem with the CAS, please report the bug in `Issues` so we can fix it
- If you have any feature suggestions not present in `Projects`, make a feature request in `Issues`
- If you would like to design a better interface than the placeholder that we have now, please contact us by email
